"you stink"
"You’re like a cloud—when you disappear, it’s a relief."
"I’d say you’re as bright as a burnt-out lightbulb, but that would be an insult to the bulb."
"You’re proof that even a broken clock is right twice a day."
"Your brain’s so small, it could be classified as a microchip."
"Your fashion sense is so outdated, I think you missed the last decade."
"I’ve seen more personality in a bag of wet cardboard."
"You have the charm of a soggy toast."
"You’re the human equivalent of a participation trophy."
"If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person alive."
"Calling you dumb would be an insult to stupid people everywhere."
